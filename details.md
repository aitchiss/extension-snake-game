# Snake

Install this extension to play Snake while waiting for your site to deploy.

## Objective

Snake is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that moves around a confined area. The objective is to eat as much food as possible to grow your snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and your own tail.

## How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
2. The snake will continuously move in the direction you choose.
3. Eat the food that appears on the screen to grow your snake and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail, as this will end the game.
5. The game gets progressively more challenging as your snake grows longer.

## Tips

- Plan your moves carefully, especially when your snake gets longer.
- Remember that you cannot move directly in the opposite direction of your current movement (e.g., if moving right, you cannot immediately move left).
- Try to leave yourself enough space to maneuver as your snake grows.
